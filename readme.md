## About programm

    The program accepts arguments, such as the word that you want to see as a result and the banner that determines how this word will be displayed in the console if the banner is not specified, then the standard one will be applied

    The program works with 1 argument that will be output to the screen as or with 2 arguments, the argument that will be output and the output method, the order is not important

    To wrap a line in the argument that will be output, the hyphen must be specified as "\\n"

    If the font files are deleted or changed, the program will not work

## How run the program:

    Go to the program directory
